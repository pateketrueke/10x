### Hello _world_

This text is not *parsed* as code,
_instead_ it is `rendered` as Markdown.

- Items and **lists** works too:
  + Even _nested_ ones, see below:
    1. OSOM!
    1. Isn't great?

You can apply **bold** and _italic_ tags, e.g.

> The _trick_ is use enough content to make it
> look <em>as</em> text, not as  `code` right?

**Code** blocks are not parsed, e.g.

```
1 + 2
```

Links and images are also supported, e.g.

> [Google][] and [Google images][1] are links,
> but ![this is an image](instead.gif "Hover me").
